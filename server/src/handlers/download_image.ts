  // 1. Validating the user owns the image generation or it's publicly accessible
  // 2. Generating a temporary download URL (signed URL for cloud storage or direct file path)
  // 3. Setting appropriate headers for file download
  // 4. Returning the download URL and original filename
  // 5. Throwing an error if the image doesn't exist or user doesn't have access
