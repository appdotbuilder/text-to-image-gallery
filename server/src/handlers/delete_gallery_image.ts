  // 1. Validating the user owns the gallery image
  // 2. Removing the gallery image record from the database
  // 3. Optionally removing the physical image file if no other references exist
  // 4. Returning success confirmation
  // 5. Throwing an error if the image doesn't exist or doesn't belong to the user
