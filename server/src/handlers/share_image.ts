  // 1. Validating the user owns the gallery image
  // 2. Checking if the image is marked as public or if user has sharing permissions
  // 3. Generating a unique share URL/token for the image
  // 4. Optionally storing the share token in database with expiration
  // 5. Returning the shareable URL
  // 6. Throwing an error if the image doesn't exist or can't be shared
